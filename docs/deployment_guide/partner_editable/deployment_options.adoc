This Quick Start provides six deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (ARM64)]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC (ARM64)]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (ARM64) with VPC Flow Logs enabled]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (x86)]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into an existing VPC (x86)]. This option provisions {partner-product-short-name} in your existing AWS infrastructure.
* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC (x86) with VPC Flow Logs enabled]. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and {partner-product-short-name} settings.
